# up-to-date-DabbleESP32
This is an update for the old library DabbleESP32. 
The orginal DabbleESP32 library was released and published almost 5 years ago and just when i wanted to use it for my project the library's old functions were incompatible with the updated ESP32 so i took matters in to my own hands and made little adjustments to get it working again. 

NOTE: I only fixed some features that caused me to be unable to upload if you are facing some issues you can contact me at nguyenxuanvinh303@gmail.com or https://www.facebook.com/vinh.nguyenxuan.98837399
